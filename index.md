---

## Annotation scope

The scope of this annotation is to detect lifestyle factors which affect the risk of disease onset and development. Below are some general examples of the guidelines that will be used in the annotation.

## General guidelines

* If a __LSF__ decreases/increases the risk/incidence of a __disease__, then this relationship is annotated as _LSF causes disease_. Examples:
  * __LSF__ decreases incidence and development risk of __disease__
  * __LSF__ victims are at increased risk for developing __disease__
  * __LSF__ carries a greater risk of __disease__
  * __LSF__ is associated with a marked increase in risk for __disease__

* If a __LSF__ is the cause of a __disease__, or a __disease__ is a result of a __LSF__, then this relationship is annotated as _LSF causes disease_. Examples:
  * __disease__ that occurs in children as a result of __LSF__
  * __LSF__ is a recognized/reversible/know/common cause of __disease__ 
  * __disease__ is one of the adverse side effects of __LSF__
